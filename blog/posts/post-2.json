  "content": "<p>Whether you’re a business owner, freelancer, or startup founder, hiring a web designer is a big decision. Your website is often the first impression potential clients get of you or your brand—so choosing the right designer matters. The key is knowing what questions to ask before you start.</p><h2>1. Can I See Your Previous Work?</h2><p>A reliable designer should have a portfolio that showcases both design skill and technical understanding. Review their past projects and check if their style aligns with your vision. Make sure their websites are fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate.</p><h2>2. What’s Included in Your Package?</h2><p>Design packages vary widely. Some cover everything—design, development, SEO, and maintenance—while others only deliver static visuals. Always confirm what’s included: content upload, mobile optimization, domain setup, or basic SEO. Knowing this upfront avoids surprise costs later.</p><h2>3. How Many Revisions Are Included?</h2><p>Feedback is part of the creative process. Ask how many revision rounds are included and how changes are handled. A professional designer will have a clear feedback system to keep the project on track without endless revisions.</p><h2>4. Which Platform Will You Use?</h2><p>Designers may specialize in platforms like WordPress, Wix, or custom-coded solutions. Each has pros and cons depending on your needs and budget. For instance, WordPress offers flexibility for growing businesses, while a custom site provides more creative freedom.</p><h2>5. Will My Website Be SEO-Friendly and Mobile-Optimized?</h2><p>In today’s world, more than 80% of visitors browse on mobile. Ensure your website loads quickly, adapts to all screen sizes, and follows SEO best practices like keyword-optimized titles, meta tags, and structured headings. This determines how easily customers find you online.</p><h2>6. Do You Offer Maintenance or Training After Launch?</h2><p>Many people overlook post-launch support. Ask whether your designer offers maintenance packages or teaches you how to manage updates. Ongoing support ensures your website remains secure, fast, and up to date.</p><h2>7. What Are Your Payment Terms?</h2><p>Always clarify payments before the project starts. A professional web designer uses a contract that specifies deliverables, timelines, and payment stages. The most common setup is 50% upfront and 50% upon completion.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Hiring a web designer isn’t just about finding someone who can make a site look good—it’s about partnering with someone who understands your goals and can help you achieve them. By asking the right questions, you ensure your website becomes a real business asset, not just an online placeholder.</p><p><a href='/services/#pricing' >View my Pricing & Features</a></p><p>Explore our affordable website packages designed for businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups ready to grow online.
