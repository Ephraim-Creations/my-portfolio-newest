  "content": "<p><strong>You should update your website every 2 to 3 months</strong>—or sooner if it looks outdated, loads slowly, or no longer matches your goals. In today’s fast-changing digital space, websites that stay fresh perform better on Google, attract more clients, and convert visitors into real leads. Let’s break down when and why an update is worth it.</p><h2>1. Your Website Looks or Feels Outdated</h2><p>If your design feels stuck in the past, visitors notice. Modern design isn’t just about style—it signals trust. Updated visuals, new fonts, and current layouts make your brand look alive and credible. If your site hasn’t changed in years, start here.</p><h2>2. It’s Not Mobile-Friendly</h2><p>In Kenya and beyond, over 80% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site doesn’t load smoothly on phones, or users must pinch and zoom, Google ranks you lower—and customers leave. A responsive redesign fixes that fast.</p><h2>3. Your Website Is Slow or Glitchy</h2><p>Speed directly impacts sales and SEO. If your site takes longer than 3 seconds to load or keeps breaking due to outdated plugins or hosting, it’s time for an upgrade. Optimized performance means better rankings and happier visitors.</p><h2>4. You’ve Changed Your Business or Goals</h2><p>As your business grows, your message changes. Maybe you’ve added new services, refined your niche, or shifted to e-commerce. If your current website doesn’t reflect where you are now, it’s holding you back. Redesign to align with your direction.</p><h2>5. You’re Not Getting Results</h2><p>If your website isn’t generating leads, bookings, or inquiries, the design might not be conversion-optimized. Modern websites use clear CTAs, engaging visuals, and data-driven layouts to boost conversions. Redesigning with purpose fixes that.</p><h2>6. You Struggle to Update Content</h2><p>If you can’t easily change text, images, or blog posts without calling a developer, your platform might be outdated. A modern CMS like WordPress or Wix gives you control and keeps your content fresh with minimal effort.</p><h2>7. Competitors Have Better Websites</h2><p>Sometimes the simplest clue is comparison. If competitors’ sites look cleaner, faster, or more interactive, it’s time to level up. A website that feels behind signals a brand that’s falling behind—don’t let that be you.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, <strong>update your website every few years—or anytime it stops performing.</strong> Think of it as digital maintenance that protects your brand and supports growth. A modern website isn’t just nice to have; it’s a key business tool that works for you 24/7.</p><p><a href='/services/#pricing'>View Website Redesign Plans</a></p><p>See our affordable website update and redesign options tailored for individuals and businesses across Kenya.
